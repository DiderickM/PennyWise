Group Project Proposal: PennyWise Financial Manager 

Project Description 

Our group has chosen to develop PennyWise, a robust financial management system designed to handle balances and transactions for multiple users. The software will serve two primary roles: Users and Administrators. 

For the general user, the system will allow for new account registration and login. Once registered, users can conduct transactions (deposits and withdrawals), view their current balances, and edit their account profiles. To ensure high utility, we will implement searching and filtering features that allow users to sort through their transaction history by date or amount. 

The Admin component will grant elevated permissions to view the entire system's records. Admins will have the authority to modify existing information, such as correcting transaction errors or updating user account statuses, ensuring data integrity across the platform. 

Why We Picked This Topic 

We selected the Financial Software theme because it provides a perfect framework to demonstrate all seven required technical elements. The logic of banking naturally lends itself to Inheritance and Polymorphism. Furthermore, the necessity of protecting sensitive financial data allows us to showcase Encapsulation by restricting direct access to private account variables. The project offers a practical, real-world application of Java that is both challenging and highly structured.
