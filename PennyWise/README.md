# This is a group project for the Erasmus University: Master Business Information management


## Group Project Proposal: PennyWise Financial Manager 

Project Description 

Our group has chosen to develop PennyWise, a robust financial management system designed to handle balances and transactions for multiple users. The software will serve two primary roles: Users and Administrators. 

For the general user, the system will allow for new account registration and login. Once registered, users can conduct transactions (deposits and withdrawals), view their current balances, and edit their account profiles. To ensure high utility, we will implement searching and filtering features that allow users to sort through their transaction history by date or amount. 

The Admin component will grant elevated permissions to view the entire system's records. Admins will have the authority to modify existing information, such as correcting transaction errors or updating user account statuses, ensuring data integrity across the platform. 

Why We Picked This Topic 

We selected the Financial Software theme because it provides a perfect framework to demonstrate all seven required technical elements. The logic of banking naturally lends itself to Inheritance and Polymorphism. Furthermore, the necessity of protecting sensitive financial data allows us to showcase Encapsulation by restricting direct access to private account variables. The project offers a practical, real-world application of Java that is both challenging and highly structured.

#### Group Project Themes
The topic of your group project can be chosen from one of the following three themes:
• Recommendation System: The software in this theme keeps a list of items. The software
allows users to search through the list according to their filers and it also returns the outputs
of the search. There is also an Admin that can edit/view the list of items. Examples include
travel packages, booking hotels, car dealers, etc.
• Survey Design: The software contains a certain survey and keeps the record of all previous
respondents. The software allows an admin to edit the survey design, collect some statistics
from the info that previous respondents have entered. For any new respondent, the software
adds the record to the list of existing records. There is no certain restriction on the context of
survey design.
• Financial Software: The software is designed for financial balances and transactions. Apart
from searching and filtering through the list, the system must allow an admin to modify the
existing info. Moreover, the software must allow new users to register and conduct some
transactions and view/edit their own account. Examples are bank accounts, Tax calculators,
expense tracker app, etc.
Any group project (regardless of the theme) must include the following elements:
1. Selections (if-else, switch, and/or conditional operators)
2. Loops (while, do-while, and/or for loops)
3. Methods (value returning and/or void)
4. Arrays (single dimensional and/or multi-dimensional)
5. Inheritance and Polymorphism
6. Interact with user (system.in)
7. Encapsulation
Note1: Make sure that you use proper spacing, indentation, and comments that highlight each of
the elements listed above. Terminal outputs must be clear.
Note2: The theme descriptions above are rather high-level and can be tailored/modified as
preferred. If you have other ideas in terms of project topic, feel free to use it.
Note3: Submit the description of your project with the information of group members by
Friday, Feb. 13th, at 23:59 through Canvas.
Note4: Submit the final version of your project by Wednesday, March 18th, at 9:00am through
Canvas.
